    <p> A microcomputer is defined as a computer with a <abbr title="central processing unit">CPU</abbr> as a microprocessor.The first computers made were big. Room size big. They were also very expensive and pretty slow and you had to be a specialist to program them. So the president of IBM, Thomas Watson, can be forgiven for his infamous quote from 1943: "I think there is a world market for maybe five computers."As the microcomputers developed and became more advanced, they would have more memory and a build in keyboard. They would also come with some sort of text-based interface – typically a specific flavor of a programming language like Basic or something similar.</p>

 <p>A microcomputer is defined as a computer with a single <abbr title="central processing unit">CPU</abbr>  as a microprocessor.Featured on the cover of the magazine Popular Electronics in January 1975 was the MITS Altair 8800 and this started the new era of the microcomputer. Limited as it were, it was still widely popular - though mainly amongst geeks. The MITS could be purchased as a DIY project, and when is was assembled it had eight switches that could be used to program it. Each switch represented one bit in the memory register and instructions were made one byte at a time.Note: The word “geek” originally (in the 16th century) meant a freak (from Dutch “gek” or Low German “geck”), but from 1983 it has been recorded in teenage slang as referring to peers with few social skills but a keen interest in new technology.</p>

 <p>One of the most well-known microcomputers was the ZX81, which came out in 1981. This computer had a wide appeal even though it had no more than 1 Kb of RAM. Later extension modules became available, so that you could upgrade to either 16 or 64 Kb. With so much RAM you could type in 64.000 characters of computer code.The ZX81 was followed by the ZX Spectrum in 1982. This one came with 16 Kb but could be upgraded to 128 Kb. 
    to use it, one would have to connect it to a television set and the resolution you’d see would be 256 x 192 pixels which equals to 32 characters across in 24 lines.The computer was able to show 8 colors and play five octaves of sound in mono.Within the next couple of years, a myriad of microcomputers hit the marked. They were now becoming known as home computers and they include machines from well-known brands like Acorn, Amstrad, Atari, Commodore, Texas and Sinclair. Two brands ended up stealing the scene - and the market: IBM and Apple.</p>

<p>The Spectrum was among the first home computers in the United Kingdom aimed at a mainstream audience, similar in significance to the Commodore 64 in the US or the MO5 in France. The introduction of the ZX Spectrum led to a boom in companies producing software and hardware for the machine,[7] the effects of which are still seen. Some credit it as the machine which launched the British information technology industry.[8] Licensing deals and clones followed, earning Clive Sinclair a knighthood for services to British industry</p>

 <h2>How to use the Microcomputers(Commodore 64)</h2>

<P>The most successful microcomputer by far was the Commodore 64. It had an 8-bit micro processer with a clock frequency at just about 1 megahertz and 64 Kb of RAM. The really extraordinary thing about the C64 though was its extra graphics chip which was able to show 16 colors, 8 sprites, had scrolling capabilities and a resolution of 320x200 pixels (40x25 characters) and it’s sound chip that could play 8 octaves of sound in 3 channels. The multimedia race had begun (although no one used that word yet).</p>

    <figcaption>C64 KEYBOARD</figcaption>
</figure>
   <p> The C64 was a keyboard with the computer inside, like most other home computers. It did have several connections on the back through which you could connect other types of hardware like joysticks, midi instruments an external storage device and a television set. The C64 was a plug-and-play (no one used that word either). When you turned it on, the curser was immediately blinking ready to take commands. The interface was text based and the programming language was Commodore Basic. Anything you wrote would be executed straight away unless you put it into a program. You created programs by adding line numbers in front of your command. This program was written line by line (not necessarily in the right order) and stored in the computers RAM. If you turned the computer off, your work would be lost unless you had stored it on an external storage device. When the program was ready you could run it by typing the command RUN followed by tapping the Return key. Disk drives were for the most part too expensive and a special cassette drive were used as a data storage device. </p>

  <p> The computer mouse had been invented, but most people had not seen or even heard of it. So in order to open up a program on a Commodore 64, one would have to write directly to the screen (which was effectively a prompt or a terminal): LOAD “PROGRAM_NAME”,8. The number would be the device to connect with. The Commodore would respond with the following lines:
    SEARCHING FOR “PROGRAM_NAME”
    LOADING
    READY.
    The program would now be loaded into the Commodore’s memory. You could have a look at the program by writing the command LIST or you could start the execution of the program with RUN.
