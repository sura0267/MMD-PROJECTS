        <p>I got my first computer in my home country Nepal; I don’t know the exact date bit I think I bought from my neighbor in 2018. It was the secondhand laptop. As I am not from rich family, I cannot afford to buy the new laptop. I bought it in the age of 20. I used to use the laptop by paying per hours in cyber. As it was the secondhand laptop, but it was in very good condition. It was Lenovo Ideapad 3i 15" Laptop, Intel Pentium 7505, 4GB Memory, 256 SSD, Windows 10 laptop. I was very happy when I got my first laptop home. I cannot explain how I feel that day. Back in that time normally people in Nepal cannot afford the SSD laptop and mine was also the laptop with 500 GB hard disk drive. Its ram was 4 GB and additionally it uses the system memory as the video memory. Its display size was 15.6-inch 1920 x 1080 (FHD) resolution. The processor was also not bad i.e., 2.30 GHZ. Overall, it was the good laptop.

     <p> I used to play games like GTA san andreas, Asphalt 8 etc. TO be honest I never did html coding before, I did got interest in multimedia design, only after I got access to the internet in my home. I found that world market has huge demand of multimedia designer, and after that I started basic html coding in my home country Nepal. I feel like I am playing in the computer world. Experimenting all those coding in html I feel like time is passing like by double of its original speed. I don’t want to leave my computer after I start coding in the HTML. In conclusion I want to thank my first computer as it showed me the right path and I applied to kea in the academic profession degree in multimedia design. That is why I didn’t sell my first computer yet. It has been used by my brother in my home country Nepal. And I don’t want to sell it as there are many feelings attached with my first computer.</p>
