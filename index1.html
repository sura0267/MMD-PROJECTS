    In the time of the microcomputer software were written specifically for each computer, as they all came with their own operating system build into them. Burned into their microchips where the commands that they understood, and programmers needed to write their programs to the specific machine. The amount of software available for a specific computer played a significant role in its success.

    This is one of the reasons for the huge success of the Commodore 64. With its powerful graphics and sound processors it was a perfect platform for games and it gave programmers a strong platform to developed all sorts. Of the more famous ones one could mention: Archon: The Light and the Dark (1983) – A mythical battle chess, Impossible Mission (1984)  - A platform action game, Pitstop II (1984) – A car race simulation, Elite (1985) – A space simulation game, Leaderboard Golf (1986) – A sport simulation, IK+ (1987) – A fighting game, International Soccer (1988) – A soccer simulation, Grand Prix Circuit (1989) – Formula One, Buck Rogers: Countdown to Doomsday (1990) – an adventure/RPG, Creatures 2: Torture Trouble (1992) – Platform type and Mayhem in Monsterland (1993) – A platform type.

 <p>A contester to the microcomputer was IBM’s so-called Personal Computer or PC although it was much pricier and did not find its way into normal homes straight away. It was a much began to change as the new IBM PC (PC for Personal Computer) entered the market. The IBM PC used a software operating system. This had to load on startup but made it easier to update - simply because you did not need to buy a completely new piece of hardware. The OS (for Operating System) was called MSDOS, this was short for Micro-Soft Disk Operating System (yes, they used a dash in their name in the early days). The code was based on the UNIX operating system although greatly simplified.</p>

<p>Computers continued to develop. In the microcomputer age the computer were mostly used as a very specialized machine. In many cases it was a toy used for gaming or a little bit of home programming. Later that changed, as the internet developed, and people began to connect. In the words of Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft and the developer of MSDOS: “I think it's fair to say that personal computers have become the most empowering tool we've ever created. They're tools of communication, they're tools of creativity, and they can be shaped by their user.”</p>
